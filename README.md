- Machine Learning flow:
1. Collect as many datasets as possible
2. Perform data cleaning on the dataset, to prevent misclassification 
3. Preprocessing the dataset before training. To optimise the training time
4. Evaluation of classification results
5. If you already have good accuracy in training and validation. Save the model into SavedModel format then convert it to TensorFlow.js model
